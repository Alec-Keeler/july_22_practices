# Practice: Express Request/Response Objects

In this practice, you will explore the request and response objects in Express.

## Getting started

Download the starter. `cd` into the __server__ folder, and run `npm install`.

Open __server/app.js__ and notice the framework for an Express server has been
created for you. In between the Express initialization and the listener are a
series of phases for you to complete.

Start the server using `npm run dev` (for automatic rebuild on save). Open your
browser to [http://localhost:5000].

> Remember to refresh the browser after the server restarts whenever you make
> changes and save the code.

## Phases

**Progress as far as you can through the phases until your instructor(s) begin
the follow-up discussion.** You can finish any additional phases later if there
is still time left today or when you are preparing for the assessment.

* Basic Phase 1 - Plain-text response
* Basic Phase 2 - Route param and JSON response
* Basic Phase 3 - Query params in URL
